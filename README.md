# DNA_family_sequencing
In this project , a machine learning model using sklearn is created  which takes in a Genomic sequence/bunch of sequences and classifies it to its respective Genomic family
This project Uses SKlearn machine learning library to create a trained model to classify the given genomes. k-mer algorithm is implemented in order to convert each genome into a set of a fixed number of strands to make the feature  process easier . bag-of-words model using a count vectorizer.Multinomial Knaive Baye's theorem was used to train the final model which would be used for the prediction. Girdsearch was implemented on the model in order to find a better value for the hyperparameter("alpha"), and a new model was created with the derived parameters, which surely increased the accuracy . The trained model was exported so that it could be deployed anywhere else. The exported trained model is attached separately in the repository.
The method of importing the model within your pythin project is described in the main project file itself.
